# Raise People Up

I've worked as a 'software engineer' since about 2013. I've been the fortunate recipient of an incredibly wide set of technical problems provided by startups and enterprise companies alike that have helped shaped the way and direction in which I have grown my technological capabilities.

Through my entire career, I've noticed one thing in particular that has begun to upset me in ways I hadn't expected: the `I got mine` principle.

An individual within a community garners enough support, help, or resources - if they like to believe themselves a lone wolf - to build themselves up to an evolutionarily advanced technological understanding. Sometimes this means learning a new popular software library to proficiency, sometimes it's partaking in a big enough project that the skills they've learn end up drilled into their head by sheer pounds of development pressure alone. In many cases, it also means an opportunity to impress someone else capabale of paying them more for their new skillset, and taking the path that new pay. This is all well and good and merit-based and yadda yadda.

What it forgets is somewhere along the process, the intern that asked about how to use the library in a specific way was forgotten. Someone that joined the company with a process that simply neglects investing time in their engineers, expecting instead for those engineering resources to somehow appreciate their value by themselves, and has absolutely no idea what's happening to them. They're in a world of permanent stagnation where their value as a typing body is just enough such that a paycheck is warranted, but the heroes and up-the-ladder folks acquiring better checks continually reinforce their lack of similar ability to form value for their parent company. 

Those folks are doomed to a kinda terrible existence of begging for challenges. They're doomed to fighting against a group of people that decided that, once `Senior Lvl 3` or `Director Lvl 1A` or `CEX` has been reached, you can simply… not think about these people. These folks have their own history and legacies to write (… sure) and they simply don't look back to remember the folks that are in the same position they were just a few short, almost cosmically meaningless years ago.

If you are one of those people that have built up a career for yourself delving in to the really hard problems in engineering life - whatever type of engineering it is - please remember to take time out to look back at the people that are following behind you.

Lend tem a hand. Give them advice. Offer some help. Take time out of your day.

The entire industry is aware that things are bad. Consumers are angry about quality. Engineers are angry about quality and accountability. C-levels are angry about not having enough shipping product fast enough to have more money. The biggest reason things are even OK these days is the corpus of folks that somehow push more than their whole self into a position, or the exact amount necessary to complete a task and nothing more.

The only way this changes if the scars of the latest breed of engineers are translated to the stories and lessons for the next. It takes time, energy, and more than a dram of giving an ever loving _shit_ about what one is doing to share a little of oneself and your brain with someone. Noone will pay you, some people may thank you.

But please, raise people up behind you. The world gets better. The software gets better. Your mindset may even get a little better as you find some enjoyment in the process. Or maybe that really isn't your bag to do it directly. Maybe talking to folks and teaching isn't your thing. If that's the case, at the very best, help those that do find this their thing to succeed, and at the worst, stay out of their way.
