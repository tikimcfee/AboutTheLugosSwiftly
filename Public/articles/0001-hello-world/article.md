# *Hello*, _world!_

This is the first article I've ever really written on this page. It's not a big one, it doesn't have too much fancy stuff if in it, in fact, it doesn't even have a good joke in it. But it's all mine!

- Swift running in the cloud with Vapor!
- No JS!
- No fancy-pants-ultra reactive hyper dockerized mega kube images with auto reloading assets!

Just some Swift, HTML and CSS. Hopefully, it stays this way for as long as possible. No fancy popups. No magic buttons. No modals. No "presentations". No fancy interactivity.

That last part kinda stinks.. but this is a pretty read-only site. I'll do my best to limit all the complicated stuff to only the pages that absolutely need it to make something work.

Also, here's a picture of me in markdown, because if it shows up, things probably, generally, are working.
