# You find a Lugo. It speaks to you in Common.

Hey there, thanks for dropping by. This is a little blog stream of conciousness thing where I write up random thoughts, share interesting links and media, and talk about some of the work I'm doing. The page itself is barebones, scriptless, doesn't track ya, and tries to be open as possible. You can [check out the source code](https://github.com/tikimcfee/AboutTheLugosSwiftly/) for everything that runs it. 

Check out navigation for topics. Expect little professionalism, great piles of emotional outburts, and a whole lot of earnest discussion about technology and the nature of humans. Mostly code though. A lot of it.

May you and yours be well.
